        <p>It’s possible you are trying to manage and change your breathe, rather than simply observe it. You don’t need to breathe in any special way, just notice your breathing as it naturally occurs.</p> 
        <p>You may try shifting your attention to a different physical sensation (e.g., your nose or shoulders) or the sound of your breath, to feel more comfortable at first.</p> 
        <p>You can also start with other types of mindfulness practices (e.g. mindful eating, mindful walking).</p>
