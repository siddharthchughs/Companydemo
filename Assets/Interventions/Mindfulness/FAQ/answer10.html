        <p>If you feel a sense of being checked out, not really present, or like things are shifting around you while practicing mindfulness, <b>gently stop and open your eyes.</b></p> 
        <p>Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique from the intro video to ground yourself: name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel or touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can taste and 1 thing you can smell.</p>
        <p>Try squeezing something (e.g. your wallet or water bottle) to activate your muscles, and increase your sense of touch and connection to your surroundings.</p> 
        <p>You may prefer to try mindfulness while keeping your eyes open.</p>
        <p>These tips can also help if you experience <b>unpleasant images or memories</b> while practicing mindfulness. And remember, <a href="../../../GetHelp/index.html">help</a> is always available.</p>
