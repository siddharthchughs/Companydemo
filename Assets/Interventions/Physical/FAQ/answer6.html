        <p>The first time we do an activity, some level of muscle soreness is to be expected, although this shouldn&rsquo;t interfere with function. </p>
        <p>If you are experiencing soreness, it should subside within 1-3 days.</p> 
        <p>Many people find that any discomfort is at its worst around 48 hours after exercise. Pain that continues to worsen after 2-3 days, or which is interfering with function, should be checked by a healthcare professional.</p>
