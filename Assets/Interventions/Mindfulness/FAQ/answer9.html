        <p>It&rsquo;s a common experience to notice pain during mindfulness.</p> 
        <p>How you respond to that pain can make a big difference. Struggling with the pain and fighting against it tends to increase our distress.</p>
        <p>See if you can accept that the pain is there, labelling it as another sensation without judging it. You can even direct your breath into the pain, seeing what happens as you create more space for it.</p> 
        <p>As you practise mindful non-judgement, you may also choose to mindfully shift your body into another position to ease your discomfort.</p>
        <p>If you experience significant pain, stop and talk to your GP about your concerns.</p>
