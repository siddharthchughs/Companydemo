        <p>Doubt is common when trying something new.</p>
        <p>Acknowledge the thought that is coming up for you, for example &quot;I&apos;m having the thought that this won&apos;t help me&quot;, and recognise it is for what it is, just a thought passing through your mind.</p>
        <p>Thoughts aren&apos;t facts, so you donâ€™t have to jump on board with each one. We can let thoughts come and go.</p>
