        <h4>Ideas for incorporating mindfulness into daily life</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="faq_body">
        <p>&bull;	Practise mindfulness while cleaning your teeth, washing dishes, standing in a line, or waiting for the kettle to boil.</p>
        <p>&bull;	Bring mindful awareness to part of your commute - walking, sitting on the train, or waiting at a traffic light.</p>
        <p>&bull;	Listen to your favourite music mindfully, directing all your attention toward the experience of listening.</p>
        <p>&bull;	Use a sound that happens regularly as a modern &apos;mindfulness bell&apos;, a cue to remind you to practise. It could be a car horn, laughter, phone notification, or a door shutting.</p>
        <p>&bull;	Set a lock screen on your phone with a picture that prompts you to be mindful.</p>
        <p>&bull;	Take 3 mindful breaths first thing when you wake up, and last thing before you go to sleep at night.</p>
        <p>&bull;	When you notice discomfort or tension in your body, imagine yourself breathing space around it, then releasing tension with your exhale.</p>
