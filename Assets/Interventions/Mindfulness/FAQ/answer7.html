        <h4>I feel anxious and panicky during mindfulness</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="faq_body">
        <p>Sometimes anxiety comes up when we put pressure on ourselves to feel a certain way during mindfulness. Remember, you don&apos;t need to achieve any particular state and there is no &apos;failure&apos;. See if you can just notice your experience, without trying to manage or control it.</p>
        <p>For some people, focusing on their body can also trigger worry about the physical sensations they notice. And when we&apos;re anxious, our fight-flight response kicks into gear, creating more strong body sensations. </p>
        <p>Even very strong anxiety sensations will pass with time. Acknowledge and name your emotions, accept them without judging yourself or your experience, and watch them come and go in their own time.</p>
