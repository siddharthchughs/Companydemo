        <h4>What is insomnia?</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="faq_body">
        <p>Insomnia is when sleep problems occur at least three nights per week, for more than three months.</p>
        <p>Insomnia can include difficulty falling asleep, waking during the night or early morning and not being able to fall back asleep, or poor sleep quality.</p>
        <p>Good sleep hygiene is the first step in addressing sleep problems, but long-term problems may require additional strategies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for insomnia or stress management techniques. Talk to your GP for more info.</p>
