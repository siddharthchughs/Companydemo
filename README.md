# Project Title

> Write a concise tagline that tells users exactly what this project does.

Write a brief description of your project here. What is it? Who is it for? If you need tips on writing a good README, read [this](https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme).

## Background (optional)

Consider including a Background section if your project depends on important but not widely known abstractions or other ecosystems. Define and link to the big concepts and abstractions one needs to understand to use and grok your project. This is also a great place to explain the module's motivation if similar projects already exist.

## Usage

Demonstrate how the user interacts with this project and what the output/result is. A great way to engage your audience is to use an [animated screen capture](http://recordit.co/) or [terminal recording](https://github.com/chjj/ttystudio) as shown below. If you do add a screenshot, put the image file in the `.github` folder to keep the repository root clean.

If this project is a library, perhaps add a brief code snippet showing how it is used.

## Getting Started

The content of this section will vary depending on the type of project. Some guidelines:

* Any prerequisite libraries/frameworks/packages should be listed in a **Prerequisites** section with links to the relevant website or download page.
* If this project has pre-built binaries supplied, an **Installation** section might be appropriate.
* For code libraries, include a snippet users can paste into their `build.gradle` or similar.
* If the project depends on a lot of third-party services, it should have a `docker-compose.yml` that can run everything at once.

## Building from source

If the user wants to build the project from source, list the steps involved.

## License

If this is an open-source project, specify and/or link to a license here. There should also be a `LICENSE.md` file at the root of the repository, which GitHub is able to recognise. Current A2I2 open-source projects use the [BSD 3-Clause](https://github.com/a2i2/surround/blob/master/LICENSE.md) license.
