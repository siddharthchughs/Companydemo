        <p>If you have an injury or illness, it&rsquo;s important to talk to a health professional before commencing a new exercise regime. </p>
        <p>Speak to your GP or an exercise specialist. Getting tailored support is also linked to better outcomes over the long term.</p>
        <p>If you use inhalers or any other medication to control a condition, such as asthma, that can be affected by physical activity, make sure that they&rsquo;re in-date and that you&rsquo;ve got them to hand every time you exercise.</p>
