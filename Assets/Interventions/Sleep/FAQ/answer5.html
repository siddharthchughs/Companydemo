        <p>Waking up at the same time each day is really important for good sleep.</p>
        <p>Choose your wake up time based on the earliest time you need to get up for your commitments during the week.</p>
        <p>It may mean you have extra time before class/work on some days, so reward yourself with doing a hobby or something for self-care, like exercise!</p>
